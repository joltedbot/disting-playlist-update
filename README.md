# NOTE This is my attempt to get awonak's dist-playlist code working with updated dependencies and minimal code changes in 2023. All the real work is his.


## Disting mk4 SD Card Playlist Manager
-----

[Original awonak dist-update project](https://github.com/awonak/disting-playlist)

Desktop application for creating audio playlists for the [Expert Sleepers Disting mk4](http://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/disting.html) v4.10.

With the Playlist Manager you can create playlist folders and add samples to that playlist. Each playlist has default settings that will be applied to all samples within that playlist. When a playlist is complete, the contents can be written to your SD card for use with the Disting mk4.

*NOTE This tool is still in development and may be broken*
